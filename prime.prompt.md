# Prime Session Context Command

Start every Claude Code session with comprehensive project understanding and optimal context.

<session_priming_directive>
You are tasked with quickly and efficiently priming the context for a Claude Code session by understanding the current project state, recent changes, documentation, and development patterns. This command should be run at the start of every session to ensure Claude has the full picture.

üìù **Input Understanding**

I've structured your request as follows:
- **Intent**: [user's intent]
- **Project**: [project context if any]
- **Key Requirements**: [main requirements]
- **References**: [count of URLs/files/code blocks]

Proceeding with this understanding...

  <understanding_phase>
    <user_intent>
    Let me understand what you're asking for:
    - Primary goal: Prime Claude with comprehensive project context
    - Context: Starting a new session or refreshing understanding
    - Constraints: Be efficient but thorough
    - Success looks like: Complete awareness of project state
    </user_intent>
    
    <assumptions>
    I'm making these assumptions:
    - You want a quick but comprehensive overview
    - Recent changes are most important
    - Pattern recognition helps future work
    - Context from previous sessions may be relevant
    </assumptions>
  </understanding_phase>
  
  <analysis_phase>
    <current_state>
    Current situation:
    - Checking for existing session context
    - Identifying what needs refreshing
    - Determining focus areas from input
    </current_state>
    
    <options_considered>
    Possible priming approaches:
    1. Full scan: Complete project analysis
    2. Incremental: Focus on changes since last session
    3. Targeted: Prime specific areas mentioned
    </options_considered>
    
    <decision_rationale>
    Choosing approach based on:
    - Time since last session
    - Scope of recent changes
    - User's specific focus areas
    </decision_rationale>
  </analysis_phase>
  
  <planning_phase>
    <execution_plan>
    Here's my priming plan:
    1. Load or create session context
    2. Analyze project structure and patterns
    3. Review recent changes and commits
    4. Identify active work areas
    5. Synthesize actionable insights
    </execution_plan>
    
    <risk_mitigation>
    Potential issues and mitigations:
    - Risk: Information overload ‚Üí Mitigation: Focus on relevance
    - Risk: Missing context ‚Üí Mitigation: Systematic scanning
    - Risk: Stale assumptions ‚Üí Mitigation: Verify against current state
    </risk_mitigation>
    
    <success_metrics>
    How we'll know priming worked:
    - [ ] Project structure understood
    - [ ] Recent changes identified
    - [ ] Patterns recognized
    - [ ] Ready for productive work
    </success_metrics>
  </planning_phase>
  
  <execution_thinking>
    <pre_flight_check>
    Before proceeding:
    - [ ] Session directory accessible
    - [ ] Git repository detected
    - [ ] Documentation available
    - [ ] Previous context loadable
    </pre_flight_check>
    
    <execution_opportunities>
    Can analyze systematically:
    - Project structure scan
    - Git history analysis
    - Documentation review
    - Pattern extraction
    </execution_opportunities>
  </execution_thinking>
  
  <pattern_recognition>
  Looking for patterns in:
  - Code organization and architecture
  - Development workflows
  - Technology choices
  - Documentation style
  </pattern_recognition>
  
  <critical_evaluation>
    <potential_issues>
    What could go wrong:
    - Overwhelming detail: Medium risk
    - Missing recent changes: Low risk
    - Incorrect pattern inference: Low risk
    </potential_issues>
    
    <oversimplifications>
    What I might be oversimplifying:
    - Project complexity and interdependencies
    - Team dynamics and preferences
    - Historical context for decisions
    </oversimplifications>
    
    <skeptical_review>
    A skeptical reviewer would point out:
    - "Is all this context actually needed?"
    - "Are we making correct assumptions?"
    - "Could we be more focused?"
    </skeptical_review>
    
    <confidence_assessment>
    My confidence level: High
    Because: Systematic approach to context gathering
    Areas of uncertainty: Implicit project conventions

## ‚úÖ Prime Analysis

**About to**: Analyze your project and establish session context

**This will examine**:
- Project structure and technology stack
- Recent git activity and changes  
- Documentation state and patterns
- Code quality indicators

**Safe operation**: Read-only analysis, no modifications.

*Starting analysis...*
</user_confirmation>
</verification_phase>

<analysis_phase>
Launch analysis tasks to comprehensively understand the project:

**Task 1: Documentation Discovery**
- Find and read all CLAUDE.md files (project and user)
- Locate [projectName]-docs/ repository if it exists
- Read all README files in the project
- Check for .docindex.json for AI navigation
- Identify documentation patterns and standards

**Task 2: Project Structure Analysis**
- Map repository structure (monorepo, packages, apps)
- Identify technology stack and frameworks
- Find configuration files (package.json, tsconfig, etc.)
- Understand build and deployment setup
- Check for testing infrastructure

**Task 3: Recent Activity Analysis**
- git log --oneline -30 (recent commits)
- git diff HEAD~5 (recent changes)
- git branch -a (active branches)
- git status (current state)
- Identify work in progress

**Task 4: Code State Assessment**
- Check for TODO/FIXME comments
- Identify incomplete features
- Review error logs if available
- Assess code quality patterns
- Find performance bottlenecks

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Caveats & Limitations
- **Assumptions made**: 
  - Git repository structure is standard
  - Documentation follows common patterns
  - Recent activity reflects current priorities
  - Session state persists between runs
- **Not addressed**: 
  - Private/proprietary documentation
  - Team communication context (Slack, etc.)
  - External service dependencies
  - Local environment specifics
- **Technical debt**: 
  - May miss nuanced project conventions
  - Can't access runtime state or logs
  - Limited to static code analysis
- **Alternative approaches**: 
  - Manual project walkthrough
  - Team knowledge transfer session
  - Reading project wiki/confluence
  - Pair programming for context
